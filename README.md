# Bayes-Decision-Rule-and-k-Nearest-Neighbour-Classifiers
Two popular classifiers are investigated; the Bayes decision Rule for normally distributed classes and the k-Nearest Neighbour decision rule.


Those experiments are carried out to obtain empirical results. This assignment is developed in Matlab and the code is available in the matlab files. The following Experiments are well detailed in 4 chapters. First, we consider the Gaussian and k-Nearest Neighbors classifiers. Secondly, the relation between the reliability of the error and the size of the test set are demonstrated. As third experiment, the dependence of the test error on the dimensionality of the pattern recognition problem are graphically illustrated and commented. Finally, the relation between the class separability and the error probability is discussed.
